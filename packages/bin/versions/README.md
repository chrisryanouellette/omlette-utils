# GitHub Action: Packages

A GitHub action that gathers all the packages within the monorepo that have a deploy script. These packages are then checked downstream to see if they have been updated and can be deployed.

## Development

1. Run `yarn dev` to start the file watcher
1. Run `yarn start` to test the add on.
